## To run this project locally:
- Clone this repo

    `git clone https://github.com/josenriagu/furry-winner.git soclone`

- Install dependencies

    `npm install`

- Create a .env file at the root of this project and put the variables below (if you don't specify NODE_ENV correctly, your server may not start and your database may not connect. lol)

    ```
    NODE_ENV=staging
    PORT=4000
    SECRET_KEY=placeYourDesiredSecretKeyHereWithNoSpaces
    ```

- Start Mongodb instance on your local machine on port `27017`

  - Your main database will be created as `mongodb://localhost:27017/soclone`

  - While your test database (when you run tests) will be created as `mongodb://localhost:27017/soclonetest`

- Run tests

    `npm test`

    or

- Run tests while watching files for changes (you may need to specify a different PORT since it may conflict with starting your server)

    `npm run test:watch`

- Start server with Node

    `npm start`

    or

- Start server with Nodemon (allows your server to refresh with file changes)

    `npm run server`
